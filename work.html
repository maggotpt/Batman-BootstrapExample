            <h4>5. Batman and his One Rule – Batman: Under the Red Hood</h4>
            <p>
              No one can deny the fact that, when it comes to messing with the
              mind, The Joker is the best at it. He relishes causing chaos and
              watching his victims struggle in the aftermath. This reality plays
              out in the fullest form towards the end of Batman: Under the Red
              Hood. With Jason Todd having finally revealed his newly
              resurrected self to Batman, he takes his former mentor to his
              hideout where he is holding his murderer, The Joker, captive. Todd
              then goes on a long rant, questioning how Bruce can live with
              himself, knowing he hasn’t killed The Joker. Batman then
              immediately cuts all the tension in the air, proclaiming that no
              matter what happens, he will not allow himself to go to that
              place; the place he knows he can never return from. Batman is THE
              symbol of hope to people and Bruce knows that if he were to stoop
              to the level of his enemies, that would make him no better than
              them. It is a truly unforgettable scene and one that showcases the
              true meaning of Batman’s one and only rule.

              4. Batman Throws Lois Lane off a Building to Beat (and help)
              Superman – Hush
            </h4>
            <p>
              During the Hush story arc, written by Jeph Loeb, Batman discovers
              that Poison Ivy has taken control of Superman using her
              mind-control powers and is using her Man of Steel puppet to
              eliminate the Dark Knight. With Superman hot on his trail, Batman
              discovers that Superman is subconsciously trying to suppress
              Poison Ivy’s control, meaning that the real Clark was still
              floating around in there. Batman then creates the hail-Mary of
              plans to break Clark out of her control. Wayne instructs Catwoman
              to kidnap Lois Lane and bring her to the top of the Daily Planet
              building. Once Catwoman has Lois Lane in position, Batman stops
              beating the living hell out of Superman and has Catwoman enact the
              second part of the plan: dropping Lois off the side of the
              building. The sight of seeing his true love fall to her death is
              enough to break Supes from the mind control as he catches Lane
              before she falls flat. While this seemed like an unforgivable
              thing, Batman’s plan demonstrates that he is willing and able to
              anything necessary in order to benefit the greater good.

            <h4>3. The Warehouse Scene – Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice</h4>
            <p>
              In Zack Snyder’s much-talked-about divisive film, fans finally got
              the Batman that Frank Miller dreamed of and the kind Arkham Asylum
              adored. When we first meet Ben Affleck’s Batman, he is a
              ceiling-crawling vigilante who brands victims with searing symbols
              of justice. He is at his lowest point and has resorted to outright
              killing low-level thugs to get the justice he wants. While his
              battle with Superman showed that there was still some humanity
              left in Bruce, the thought of letting Clark’s mother die was not
              going to have him return to being the no-killing hero. In an
              absolutely stunning sequence, Snyder unleashes the Gotham Bat.
              Hurling crates that split skulls and whipping jagged-edged
              Batarangs at his enemies, Batman brutally destroys all of Lex
              Luthor’s criminals as he fights his way to the KGBeast’s room.
              When he sees Martha at the end of a flamethrower, Batman ignites
              the weapon, killing everyone in the room and saving Martha’s life.
              Say what you will about the movie, but this warehouse sequence is
              the most brutal Batman we’ve seen yet.

            </h4>
            <p>
              Similarly to Batman 89, Batman: The Animated Series made expert
              use of the hero’s catchphrase. As Scarecrow’s fear toxin sets in,
              Batman hangs on to the nose of a zeppelin. His worst fears comes
              to life as he struggles to hang on for his life. A dark vision of
              his father inspires the hero to snap out his fear, loudly
              proclaiming that he is not failure; “I am vengeance, I am the
              night, I am Batman!” It is arguably the series’ most iconic and
              inspiring moment, showcasing that Batman is someone who never
              gives up, even when he’s at the brink of breaking. He climbs from
              the zeppelin, finds Scarecrow and defeats him once and for all. In
              a series that has been called the best interpretation of the
              character, this moment alone is arguably the sole reason needed to
              back up this claim.

            <h4>1. Batman Interrogates The Joker – The Dark Knight</h4>
            <p>
              A film that has been hailed as the greatest superhero movie of all
              time, Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight looked to strip both
              Batman and Joker down to their core. Which brings us to our number
              one Batman moment ever, the interrogation sequence. When
              Commissioner Gordon exits the soiled interrogation room, he leaves
              behind the darker version of himself: Batman in full rage mode.
              Lit only by a solitary light, the Joker watches as Gordon heads to
              the door, sniveling, “ah, the good cop, bad cop routine?” Not
              exactly. Batman immediately smashes the clown’s deranged head into
              the table, commencing a cross-examination of the most violent
              order. After an incredible back and forth exchange; one that
              further pushes Batman down the path of anger, Joker reveals that
              he not only kidnapped Harvey Dent, but Rachael Dawes as well. This
              is Batman at the height of desperation and Joker at the peak of
              his power. The Joker desires Batman’s life (“you complete me”),
              while the Dark Knight continues to squash his rooted desire to
              murder him (“you’re garbage who kills for money”). The scene then
              becomes a race against time, as Batman fails to save Rachael while
              Harvey has half his body burned from the flames of the explosion.
              This is a sequence that exemplifies the longest, and most storied
              rivalry in DC Comics history. It is not a battle of fists but
              rather of the mind. It embraces the ridiculousness of Batman and
              his arch nemesis while affirming Gotham’s need for such a
              protector. It is heartbreaking, pulse-pounding and our pick for
              the greatest Batman moment in history.
