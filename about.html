          <h1>Who is Batman?</h1>
          <p>
            Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha Kane,
            two very wealthy and charitable socialites from Gotham City. Bruce
            was brought up in the wealthy splendor of Wayne Manor and leads a
            happy and privileged existence until roughly the age of eight. While
            returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time
            criminal named Joe Chill. After the incident, Bruce swears an oath
            to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives. As he
            grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical
            training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts,
            fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning
            to Gotham, Bruce realizes that these skills alone would not be
            enough. "Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot", Wayne
            remarks, "so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their
            hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible..." As if
            responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window,
            inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.
